            <h3> Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>
                <p>Designing and developing sites in a responsive way means responding to user behavior and the equipment environment like on screen size. There are many kind of devices with different pixals size but our design would adopt any screen size and can be automatically fixed to the screen sized with their adopted resolution. </p>
            
            <h3> How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
            <p>As a result of web technology, responsive design is associated with web applications that are displayed on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computer monitors. This format ensures the web application is shown at its best across all devices, an essential success factor for generating a great user experience. CSS is largely used in web technology for responsive design. Using CSS, you can standardize properties across applications. </p>
                
            <h3> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>
                <p>Responsive Images empowers designers to use different image sizes and resolutions to create responsive layouts. Devices are available in a variety of sizes, so screen sizes may vary greatly. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, are among the smallest, yet most frequently accessed devices by consumers to access web applications. Adapting content to the screen size is crucial for web apps. Due to the limited area available on smaller devices, intuitive CSS design is essential because content must be displayed efficiently and concisely.</p>
            
            <h3> Describe your learning experience in the course</h3>
            <p>My learning experience throughout the web222 was very good I have learned basic application of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and web designing which was very helpful for me to gain knowledge about web design and coding for website development. I studied javascript in my highschool but its just basic and at that time i find it interesting and want to study more in my future. This course will help me to increase my knowledge related to JS, HTML, and CSS.  </p>
